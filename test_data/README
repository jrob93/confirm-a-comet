An example ATLAS tracklet composed of 4 exposures.
Each frame is centred on the detcted moving object.
There is a set of reduced data including the background stars, this is used to compare the possible comet PSF to the stellar PSF (comets are spread out).
The diff data has had the background stars removed, leaving only the transient features. This is stacked to boost the comet signal and to examine the coma.
